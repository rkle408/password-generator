# password-generator

## Developed a password generator that produces a random sequence based on your preferences for length and different types of characters

With how fast technology is moving, more and more of our private lives are being put online. We all <i>know</i> that we shouldn't use our favorite pet's name as a password... but how many of us do that just because we cannot come up with a new password?! Well, that's what this project was developed for... to generate a random password for users, with their choice of character types!

Through using my own knowledge bank and researching how to build this generator, I learned that there are a multitude of ways to write this code utilizing JavaScript. The most important aspect is that you keep the logic intact. One of my biggest lessons in completing this project is that I have a lot more to learn, and no matter how comfortable I feel with something, there is always more to learn. Javascript, while difficult to learn, has many characteristics that simplify different aspects in the long run. In my opinion, it would be a very humbling experience to come back to this project, and write completely new code.
